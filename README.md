# 2020-campaign
This project's goal is to explore 2020 campaign data, plotting it, and looking for trends and correlations between campaign movements on the ground and various outcome metrics such as betting odds and poll results.

Scraping betting odds for the 2020 presidential campaign, specifically Democratic and Republican primary winners, and the presidential race winner. Plots of odds over time are made for each betting line, and more lines will be included as they're made available.

Other metrics to include:
1. Internet traffic. Can be measured with API calls to Google.
2. Unique donations. Unique donation numbers require voluntary disclosure by each candidate, can't be gathered hourly.
3. Media engagements. These can drive support and donor numbers considerably by reaching many viewers.
4. Campaign stop locations.

All of the above can be plotted over a basemap of U.S. states, counties or House districts, and will show where candidates are focusing their efforts relative to voter variables.

Voter variables of interest:
Demographics and geography matter. Each campaign is limited by their resources to varying degrees as well as the constraints of the electoral college. This is why candidates spend more time in swing states like Iowa, Michigan, Florida, etc, where bang-for-campaign-buck is the greatest. Different issues are appealing to different demographics: white women care more deeply about reproductive rights than white middle-aged men who have been laid off by the millions, who may care more about economic considerations than wealthy financiers in New York. Deep seated moral values play into each of these as well, and can cause, rightly or wrongly, voters to vote counter to their personal interests. Ancestrally selected values, instincts, compulsions and tastes are generally fixed across the lifespan, and don't comprehend social trends, incorporate facts about those trends, or do so at the scale of a 327 million member group. Nor are they, despite being seated in the brain, any more objective or malleable than other instincts, and can serve as a constant, powerful metric that holds predictive capability if measured accurately. Thus, there is a nexus of geography, demographics, political issues, values, and other factors that may be useful to know. Obviously there is an overwhelming amount of information to gather and process. The initial focus will be on the easiest sources to gather data and plot it quickly. More disorganized datasets will be gathered last.
